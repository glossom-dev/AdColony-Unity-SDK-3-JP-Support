Getting Started with AdColony Unity:
---------------------------------------
This Unity plugin integrates our Aurora SDK into a package that can be included in Unity 3D applications, and includes the latest versions of both our iOS and Android Aurora SDKs.

Our Aurora SDK contains huge leaps forward in our capabilities, with benefits for both publishers and advertisers. We would also like to highlight the addition of AdColony Compass™ to our suite of products. AdColony Compass provides publishers with intuitive marketing tools to maximize the value of users throughout your app economy, like creating rewards, achievements, push notifications and in-app messaging.

Please note that updating from our 2.x Unity Plugin is not a drag and drop update, but rather includes breaking API and process changes. In order to take advantage of the 3.x Unity Plugin, a complete re-integration is necessary. Please review our [documentation](https://github.com/AdColony/AdColony-Unity-SDK-3/wiki) to get a better idea on what changes will be necessary in your app.

AdColony Compass™ provides the tools to increase user engagement through targeted user communications, achievements and rewards. Combined with AdColony’s award-winning Instant-Play™ HD video ads, Compass™ features can also stimulate monetization within apps.Compass™ tools allow publishers to incentivize desired user behaviors and improve KPI's for apps without heavy development work or altering carefully balanced in-app economies.
